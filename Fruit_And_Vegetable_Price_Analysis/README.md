[View the interactive story here on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leng.yang/viz/FruitandVegetablePriceAnalysis/FruitVegetableStory)

## Introduction

This Tableau story provides a detailed analysis of fruit and vegetable prices through four distinct bar charts. Two of the charts focus on comparing the price per cup equivalent for different forms of produce, such as canned, fresh, frozen, etc., allowing users to easily compare options for each. The other two charts display yearly price comparisons showing trends from 2013 to 2022. This story allows users to explore both form-based price variations and long-term price trends, providing a comprehensive view of the produce market. With clear visualizations and intuitive navigation, users can make informed decisions based on pricing data across different categories and time periods.

## Methodology
- **Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data by handling blanks, changing data types, and created new columns.
- **Core Charts:** Utilized bar charts to compare pricing across the different produce as well as for trend analysis.
